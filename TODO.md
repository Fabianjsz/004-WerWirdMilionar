# 27.04.2025 progress

- [x] display data in specified labels on gui
- [x] Implement data selection via double click on treeview
- [x] Create a second popup function, for when deleting or editing data

## Must do's

- [ ] make it so deletion is also selected via treeview
- [ ] create a gui for question edits, with filled out entrys for answer a-d
- [ ] Edit editDatabase so you can edit multiple Entrys in one primary key entry
- [ ] Create a playing mask

## Icing on the cake

- [ ] Create a main menu gui in which you can enter and exit admin mask and playing mask
- [ ] refactor databaseUtility, so one function can be reused for multiple cases
